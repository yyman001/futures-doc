**Index exception handling**

- Removing invalid prices:

When any source exchange price is not updated within 40000ms and the value of the previous value is too different, we will assume that its price is mistaken, at this calculation the right to reset the exchange to 0.

- Abnormal price correction:

When the price of an exchange deviates significantly from that of other exchanges and the median deviation of the price of all source exchanges (including the exchange itself) by ±3%, the price of that exchange is calculated at the median ±3% of the sample exchange price (when the median deviation of the USDT price reaches ±0.3%, the price of that exchange is calculated at the median ±0.3% of the sample exchange price).
